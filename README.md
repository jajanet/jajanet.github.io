# Visit my personal site [here](https://jajanet.github.io)
Last deployment can be seen in the repo's [deployment's page](https://github.com/jajanet/jajanet.github.io/deployments)

If my resume is out of date here, you can look at [this possibly more recent one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nvu1cbXBISaQ5G7-NTKE06lrBsSfXDuY8kFAbidQ7dk/)

## Installation
Make sure you have a recent version of `node` installed. For managing node versions, I recommend using nvm.

Terminal commands:
`git clone https://github.com/jajanet/jajanet.github.io.git`

`cd jajanet.github.io`

`npm install`

## Running
Terminal command:`npm run start`

Go to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Deploying changes
I did some sort of Github pages setup and it's out of date now -- it works and I just run `npm run deploy` to push the latest version of my site to gh-pages (build code is deployed to the gh-pages branch). Generally the npm are setup in the package.json file if you wanted to look into those

This is mostly a note to myself, as I don't plan on doing too much clean up here. I wrote this most of this in 2020 through CodeSandbox, and the structure and content is moreso to experiment and express myself for fun

## Fun :)
If you tried exploring around my page and are curious about the little interactions I have on my site, click the spoiler:
>! changing background fill duration, pausing background fill changes, going forward/backwards, random fills for svg images (with drop shadows!), hiding duration change when pausing, toggling hidden text, toggling more detailed text.

I had fun creating this site and using various effects, hooks, and animations purely using frontend and I hope you enjoy it!

### TODO
- Add projects and their descriptions/links
